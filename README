A short script to fix Slipshine's broken RSS feed.

All links are replaced with their real link instead of just
'http://members.orgymania.net/'.  I've also added a guid for each item.  This
fixes update issues with some RSS clients.

rss-fix.pl requires XML::RSS, while rss-fix_no-xml-rss.pl does not.  Both
require LWP::Simple and Digest::MD5.

Note: this is meant to run on a webserver and act as a proxy to slipshine's
feed.  Requires a webserver capable of runing perl via CGI scripts.
